## How to Use This Documentation

1. Start with the **overview.md** to understand the high-level strategy
2. Review the **implementation-plan.md** for the detailed roadmap
3. Consult specific feature specs when implementing a particular component
4. Follow the architecture guidelines to maintain consistency with existing patterns

## Progress Tracking

The implementation plan includes checkboxes to track progress through each phase of development. These will be updated as features are completed.

## Relationship to Existing Documentation

This documentation extends the core architecture principles defined in:
- `.github/CORE_PRINCIPLES.md` 
- `.github/AI_DEVELOPMENT.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`

All implementation must conform to the rules and patterns defined in these documents.
