# Authentication System - Detailed Implementation Plan

> This detailed plan extends the [Authentication System Specification](./authentication.md) with specific implementation tasks and architectural decisions based on project discussions. The authentication system will integrate with Supabase and follows industry best practices.

## Overview

This document outlines the detailed plan for implementing a secure, multi-tenant authentication system that supports both system-level and tenant-level roles with appropriate permission granularity.

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Authentication State Structure

- [ ] **User Identity Management**
  - [ ] Core user profile (id, name, email, etc.)
  - [ ] Security metadata (registration date, last login, update timestamps)
  - [ ] Profile image/avatar handling
  - [ ] User preferences storage
  - [ ] Extensibility mechanism for future project-specific user attributes (not in initial implementation)
  - [ ] Synchronization between Supabase Auth and database user tables

- [ ] **Tenant Context Management**
  - [ ] Current active tenant tracking
  - [ ] Role-appropriate tenant visibility (superadmin sees all, users only see assigned tenants)
  - [ ] Tenant switching UI below logo/above menu on left sidebar
  - [ ] Tenant metadata and settings

- [ ] **Role Management**
  - [ ] System roles (not tenant-specific)
  - [ ] Tenant-specific roles
  - [ ] Role metadata (name, description, etc.)
  - [ ] Role switching capability

- [ ] **Session Management**
  - [ ] Authentication status tracking
  - [ ] Token storage and lifecycle
  - [ ] Session timeout handling
  - [ ] Multi-device session support

- [ ] **Error Handling**
  - [ ] Authentication error categorization
  - [ ] User-friendly error messages
  - [ ] Security-conscious error details

### 2. Authentication Methods

- [ ] **Standard Authentication**
  - [ ] Email/password authentication
  - [ ] Remember me functionality
  - [ ] Password validation rules
  - [ ] Account lockout after failed attempts

- [ ] **Token Management**
  - [ ] JWT structure and claims design
  - [ ] Access token management
  - [ ] Refresh token rotation
  - [ ] Token revocation capabilities

- [ ] **Multi-Factor Authentication**
  - [ ] 2FA setup framework
  - [ ] TOTP implementation
  - [ ] Backup codes system
  - [ ] Remember device option

- [ ] **Social/SSO Integration**
  - [ ] OAuth provider framework
  - [ ] Tenant-specific SSO setup
  - [ ] Identity mapping and merging

### 3. Role & Permission System

- [ ] **Permission Structure** (Based on Filament Shield model)
  - [ ] Resource-action permission format (`resource:action`) at system level
  - [ ] Tenant-scoped permission format (`tenant:resource:action`) for tenant-specific permissions
  - [ ] Standard CRUD actions per resource (view, create, update, delete)
  - [ ] Extended actions for custom operations
  - [ ] System vs tenant permission scoping
  - [ ] Permission grouping by resource for efficient management of numerous permissions
  - [ ] Permission auditing and logging

- [ ] **Role Structure**
  - [ ] System-level roles (not tenant-specific)
  - [ ] Tenant-specific admin roles (e.g., "Admin-{TenantName}")
  - [ ] Base user role for personal settings management
  - [ ] Dynamic role creation at both system and tenant levels
  - [ ] Role hierarchy with inheritance patterns
  - [ ] Multiple roles per user support

- [ ] **Superadmin Handling**
  - [ ] Superadmin role with global access
  - [ ] Permission bypass logic
  - [ ] Superadmin audit logging
  - [ ] Superadmin UI indicators
  - [ ] Protection against superadmin role deletion or modification
  - [ ] First user auto-assigned as superadmin
  - [ ] Prevention of deleting last superadmin user
  - [ ] User impersonation capability (superadmin can act as any user)
  - [ ] Tenant admin impersonation capability (superadmin can act as tenant admin)

- [ ] **Permission Checking**
  - [ ] Policy-based permission checks
  - [ ] UI component conditionals
  - [ ] Permission-based routing
  - [ ] Permission caching for performance
  - [ ] Role-aware permission evaluation

### 4. Token Storage & Security

- [ ] **Token Storage Strategy**
  - [ ] In-memory access token storage
  - [ ] Secure refresh token storage
  - [ ] Token encryption if needed
  - [ ] Storage cleanup on logout

- [ ] **Security Measures**
  - [ ] CSRF protection
  - [ ] XSS prevention
  - [ ] HTTP-only cookie configuration
  - [ ] Secure headers implementation

- [ ] **Token Lifecycle**
  - [ ] 30-minute access token lifetime
  - [ ] Automatic token refresh at ~22 minutes (75% of lifetime)
  - [ ] Sliding expiration for refresh tokens
  - [ ] Token invalidation on security events
  - [ ] Session tracking for concurrent login management

### 5. Invitation System

- [ ] **Invitation Creation**
  - [ ] System-level invitations
  - [ ] Tenant-level invitations
  - [ ] Role pre-assignment in invitations
  - [ ] Invitation expiration settings

- [ ] **Invitation Acceptance**
  - [ ] **Email Verification**: Leverage Supabase's built-in email verification rather than implementing a custom solution, with tenant-aware post-verification redirects.
  - [ ] First-time password setup
  - [ ] Post-registration onboarding

- [ ] **Invitation Management**
  - [ ] Invitation tracking and status
  - [ ] Re-sending capabilities
  - [ ] Invitation cancellation
  - [ ] Bulk invitation tools

### 6. UI Component Integration

- [ ] **Login Component Enhancement**
  - [ ] Login form validation
  - [ ] Error handling improvements
  - [ ] Remember me functionality
  - [ ] Post-login role/tenant context handling

- [ ] **Role & Tenant Switcher Components**
  - [ ] Dropdown design for role switching
  - [ ] System/tenant role categorization
  - [ ] Visual indicators for current role/tenant
  - [ ] Permission context refresh on switch
  - [ ] Positioned below logo/above menu in left sidebar
  - [ ] Tenant switching with appropriate visibility controls

- [ ] **User Profile Components**
  - [ ] Profile editing interface
  - [ ] Password change functionality
  - [ ] 2FA management UI
  - [ ] Session management interface

- [ ] **Admin Interfaces**
  - [ ] User management screens
  - [ ] Role and permission management
  - [ ] Invitation management
  - [ ] Access audit logs
  - [ ] User impersonation links in user table (superadmin only)
  - [ ] Tenant admin impersonation links in tenant table (superadmin only)

## Implementation Phases

- [ ] Token handling and storage
- [ ] Integration with existing login UI

### Phase 2: Multi-Tenant & Role Features

## Service Interfaces

### Authentication Service

```typescript
// Conceptual interface - not actual implementation
interface AuthenticationService {
  // Core authentication
  login(email: string, password: string, options?: AuthOptions): Promise<AuthResult>;
  logout(): Promise<void>;
  refreshToken(): Promise<TokenResult>;
  
  // Session management
  getSession(): Session | null;
  validateSession(): boolean;
  
  // Tenant/role management
  switchTenant(tenantId: string): Promise<void>;
  switchRole(roleId: string): Promise<void>;
  getAvailableRoles(): Promise<Role[]>;
  
  // Permission checking
  hasPermission(permission: string): boolean;
  hasAnyPermission(permissions: string[]): boolean;
  hasAllPermissions(permissions: string[]): boolean;
  
  // User management
  updateProfile(data: Partial<UserProfile>): Promise<UserProfile>;
  changePassword(oldPassword: string, newPassword: string): Promise<void>;
  resetPassword(email: string): Promise<void>;
  
  // Invitation handling
  acceptInvitation(token: string, userData: UserRegistrationData): Promise<void>;
}
```

## Testing Strategy

- [ ] **Unit Tests**
  - [ ] Authentication hook tests
  - [ ] Permission utility tests
  - [ ] Token management tests

- [ ] **Integration Tests**
  - [ ] Complete authentication flows
  - [ ] Role switching tests
  - [ ] Invitation workflow tests

- [ ] **Security Tests**
  - [ ] Token security tests
  - [ ] Permission boundary tests

Current progress: 0%

## Implementation Notes

- The authentication system will integrate with Supabase for backend services
- Maintain careful synchronization between Supabase Auth and database user tables
- Implement tenant-specific admin roles following the naming pattern "Admin-{TenantName}"
- Follow the Filament Shield model for permission structure (`resource:action`)
- Set access token lifetime to 30 minutes with automatic refresh
- Use Supabase's built-in email verification capabilities
- All UI components must maintain the existing design system and UX patterns
- Authentication state should be persisted appropriately for seamless user experience
- Build the user profile system to be extensible for project-specific attributes
- Security best practices must be followed throughout implementation
